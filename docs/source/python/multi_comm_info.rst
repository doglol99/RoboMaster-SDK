==================================
Multi-device Communication System
==================================

The multi-device communication system implements communication between robots through a local area network (LAN). With this system, you can have multiple robots collaborate to realize functions such as performances in formation.

When using this system, you must add all target robots to the same LAN and use the official Python API for programming in order to implement the communication mechanism between robots and realize other functions.

For the Python API, refer to :doc:`Custom UI System<./multi_comm>`.
